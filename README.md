# browserify-individual-assignment-kellycook301

This was a small individual project and I had a lot of fun doing it.
I started off rocky because my setup was kinda wonky. But once I was up and running things went fairly smoothly.
It was similar to the individual modules we had to do for Nutshell, which was cool. There was a lot of crossover in functionality. I did not incorporate any sort of login. One thing I wanted to do was incorporate some Bootstrap to make it look a little more appealing. So the forms I did in the Nutshell project were altered to be Bootstrap forms and cards.

## Bootstrap
Some Bootstrap stuff was not very cooperative with me, and that's because I know I don't know EVERYTHING. So I did some stuff 
to work my way around my problems. Some issues were solved in CSS after the data was all there.

## Fonts
I wanted to use a Google Font but I could not seem to get it to work even though I included the href in html and targeted it
in my CSS. I know there's a way to do it, but because we could not ask for help, I left it alone. I Googled the issue for sure! However, I was unable to get the font up and running.

## Gimp
Gimp is a free photo-editing program. I have used it before on personal music and arts projects before. To get around the 
font issue, I created a "logo" in Gimp and was able to make a transparent layer so that that "logo" appeared over the background image without obstructing anything.

## Background Image
During one of Cohort 26's capstone projects I noticed that someone had a static image as a background. I knew that I didn't want to have the same background image repeat as more entries were being printed to the DOM. I found something on stackoverflow that someone posted something that would make the target image static.

>body {
>
background-image: url("airport.jpg");
>
background-repeat: no-repeat;
>
background-attachment: fixed;
>
}

## Fin
It was a fun project. I would have liked to get an edit feature implemented, but I think I would have needed some guidance. I was trying to build off of a Nutshell module, but realized it might have been a little bit more than what I wanted to get into for the end of the day. Capstone project for sure!
